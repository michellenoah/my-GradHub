    <h2>Project Description:</h2>

    <p>We want to create a website that aims towards helping international students who are considering to continue
        their education in the United States. We have all the information you would need on educational, social,
        cultural and economic aspects of studying in the US to help you decide which area is the best place for you. In
        order to assist international students, we will have four sections on our website: Housing, Finance & Budget,
        Parks & Recreational Activities, Food & Culture.</p>

    <h2>Project Scope:</h2>

    <p>The project will include research, writing, content strategy and web design. The final product is idealized to be
        a website where international students can look for information needed on educational, social, cultural and
        economic aspects of studying in the US. Each of the sections will include its filters to make the website
        user-friendly.</p>
